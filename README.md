[Download LaunchNow](https://launchnow.gooxsoft.com/) · Alternative Launchpad for macOS Tahoe

LaunchNow is a polished fork of [ggkevinnnn/LaunchNow](https://github.com/ggkevinnnn/LaunchNow) that keeps your launchpad fast, organized, and fully under your control.

## Highlights
- **Streamlined settings** with intuitive sections for General, Appearance, Grid Layout, App Management, App Sources, Data, and About.
- **Custom grid designer** to tune columns (3–12), rows (2–8), and instantly preview the layout.
- **App Sources control** to add external drives or custom folders that LaunchNow monitors alongside the default system locations.
- **Smart controls** for fullscreen classic mode, scrolling sensitivity, and background reminders.
- **Power tools** to add, remove, or reset apps with searchable sheets and guardrails for destructive actions.
- **Backup & restore** workflows that validate SwiftData stores before importing.
- **One-click maintenance** to rescan layouts, refresh the grid, and quit cleanly.

## Quick Start
1. Download the app and move it to `Applications`.
2. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security → allow the unidentified developer prompt.
3. (Optional) Add LaunchNow to Login Items to keep it ready at launch.
4. In Settings → Import, choose the apps you want to add.
5. Drag apps to reorder or group them into folders on the fly.
6. Hit the down arrow or return key for full keyboard navigation, and scroll to flip pages.
7. Need a fresh slate? Use Reset Apps to clear the LaunchNow grid (your disk apps stay untouched).
